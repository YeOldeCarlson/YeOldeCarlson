I have recently graduated with an Associate's in Software Development. I'm not the most skilled at C#, Javascript and SQL Server 
but I'm always looking to improve!

I enjoy playing video games and reading books. My favorite book series is Dune and The Witcher books; whereas my favorite gaming
series include The Legend of Zelda, Final Fantasy and the Bravely Series.
